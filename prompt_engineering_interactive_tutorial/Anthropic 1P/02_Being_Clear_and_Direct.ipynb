      "\n",
      "\"Bloody hell!\" he exclaimed, slamming his fist on the desk in frustration. \"Why won't this bloody thing work?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His colleagues, used to Liang's occasional outbursts, simply shook their heads and carried on with their own tasks, leaving him to his struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the days turned into weeks, Liang's determination only grew stronger. He spent long hours tinkering with the code, tweaking and refining it, trying to find the elusive solution that would make his agent work as he intended. But each time he thought he had it figured out, the agent would throw a new curveball, leaving him back at square one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is bloody ridiculous!\" he growled, running his fingers through his hair in frustration. \"I've tried everything, and it's still not working!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His boss, a no-nonsense Australian with a keen eye for detail, had been keeping a close eye on Liang's progress. She had seen the young developer's potential, and she was determined to help him succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mate, I can see you're struggling with this,\" she said, placing a hand on his shoulder. \"Why don't you take a break and come back to it with fresh eyes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Liang nodded, grateful for the respite. He leaned back in his chair, taking a deep breath and trying to clear his mind. But the agent's stubborn refusal to cooperate continued to nag at him, and he found himself unable to truly relax.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun began to set, Liang returned to his desk, his determination renewed. He pored over the code once more, scrutinizing every line, searching for the elusive bug that was causing the agent to malfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" he suddenly exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. \"I've got it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With renewed vigor, he set to work, his fingers flying across the keyboard as he made the necessary adjustments. The agent, once a source of frustration, now seemed to respond to his commands, executing the tasks he had set out with precision and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liang leaned back in his chair, a triumphant grin spreading across his face. \"Take that, you bloody agent!\" he said, chuckling to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his victory was short-lived. The next day, as he tried to replicate the agent's performance, it once again refused to cooperate, reverting to its old, glitchy ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come on!\" Liang groaned, his shoulders slumping in defeat. \"What the bloody hell is wrong with this thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent the rest of the day trying to troubleshoot the issue, but no matter what he did, the agent remained stubbornly uncooperative. By the time he finally called it a night, he was exhausted, both physically and mentally.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he made his way home, Liang couldn't help but reflect on the lessons he had learned throughout this arduous process. He had discovered the importance of patience, of not giving up in the face of adversity. He had also learned the value of taking breaks, of stepping back and looking at the problem from a fresh perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite these hard-won insights, the struggles with the coding agent persisted. Liang knew that he would have to continue to put in the hard work, to keep tinkering and experimenting, if he wanted to finally conquer this challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get you, you bloody agent,\" he muttered to himself, his determination unwavering. \"Just you wait and see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the days turned into weeks, Liang's dedication only grew stronger. He spent long hours poring over the code, trying to identify the root cause of the agent's erratic behavior. He experimented with different approaches, testing and retesting, until he finally stumbled upon a breakthrough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" he exclaimed, his eyes lighting up with triumph. \"I've got it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With renewed confidence, Liang set to work, his fingers flying across the keyboard as he implemented the necessary changes. This time, the agent responded flawlessly, executing the tasks he had set out with precision and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liang leaned back in his chair, a satisfied smile spreading across his face. \"Take that, you bloody agent!\" he said, chuckling to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he presented his work to his boss, she couldn't help but be impressed. \"Well done, mate,\" she said, clapping him on the back. \"I knew you had it in you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Liang beamed with pride, knowing that his hard work and perseverance had paid off. But even as he celebrated his victory, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of apprehension. After all, he had learned the hard way that the struggles with the coding agent were far from over.\n",
